# HIMEana - Analyze HIME Data

HIMEana serves to analyze data from the Neutron Detector 
"HIgh-resolution detector array for Multi-neutron Events" (HIME).

## Initial Setup
1. Go to directory `data` and create a symbolic link called `unpacked` that points towards your unpacked data:
    `ln -s [path] unpacked`.
    Inside `unpacked`, create a directory for each **experiment**, in which arbitrarily many ROOT files can be located, each one representing a **run**.
2. Go to directory `common` and modify the settings section: 
   1. Choose the root version you want to source.
   2. (optional) Modify the command that is used to call ROOT. This might be useful if you are using an older version of ROOT that does not yet include a web server to display all your instances of TCanvas, TBrowser, etc. in your web browser.
   3. Enter the complete absolute path to your `himeAna` directory.
3. In the same directory `common`, type `./compileCommons.sh`. This will create shared libraries that are loaded in each of the individual analysis steps.


## Structure of the HIMEana Tools
The two main parts of HIMEana are `fourChannel` and `multiChannel`. The former is used to have a look on uncalibrated data from up to 4 channels and allows to cut on coincidences between two modules. The latter is used to calibrate all modules of HIME in time, position and energy, which is done is multiple steps. For each step, there is a subdirectory in `multichannel`, which reads and writes from/to the corresponding subdirectories of `data`. 

To some of the subdirectories of `data`, CSV files have to be added manually. See [Configure Details about the Setup of HIME](#configure-details-about-the-setup-of-hime).

The reason for the full analysis being divided in small steps is that the output should be checked carefully after each part of the calibration. Besides, there are two different approaches available for the position calibration.

### Configure Details about the Setup of HIME
In the directories `data/thresholds`, `data/geometry/` and `data/channelMapping/`, CSV files have to be added manually in order to correctly configure the calibration procedure:
1. `data/channelMapping/`: Tells which channels belong to the same module.
2. `data/thresholds`: ToT values for all modules above which the muon hits are located. Used to cut away low-energetic terrestrial background.
3. `data/geometry/`: Lists the positions of all modules.

### Steps of the multiChannel Analysis
In the following, the individual parts of the multiChannel analysis are listed.
1. `tDiff`: The bare unpacked data contain time stamps for the rising and falling edges of all signals in each channel, as well as the number of the trigger signal of each event. In this analysis step, the ToT values and the time differences of detection in the two PMTs of each module are calculated from the sequences of signals. Besides, one can select data from a specific trigger type.
2. Position calibration (two choices):
   - either simple:
     1. `simplePositionCalibration`: Treats each module individually and calculates each linear calibration function from two data pairs (consisting of time difference and position) only. Rather simple and robust method.
   - or based on muon tracking:
     1. `trackingForPositionCalibration`: Tracks cosmic muons through the detector and writes down correlation plots of time differences (i.e., time difference of detection of the signals of the two PMTs of each module) and muon position for each module. This is a rather complicated method, so its results should be checked carefully. It gets more precise with a larger number of layers and modules.
     2. `positionCalibrationFromTracking`: Fits linear calibration functions to the previously determined correlation plots.
3. `applyPositionCalibration`: Applies the position calibration on the data.
4. `trackingForEnergyCalibration`: Tracks again muons in HIME, but makes use of the position calibration. The results are correlation plots of ToT and muon-energy deposition. The latter is calculated from the track lengths of the cosmic particles inside each module.
5. `energyCalibration`: Fits calibration functions to the previously determined correlation plots.

## Compile and Start
Four each component (`fourChannel` and each step of `multiChannel`) of HIMEana, there is at least one shell script that is used to compile the source code and to start the analysis if the compilation was successful. These shell scripts are called `start.sh` and `loop.sh`. The former will start a single thread only, analyzing a single file. The latter will start a number of threads in parallel. The amount of threads can be specified in `thread_goal.txt`. Having this number in a separate text file (instead of having it hard coded in the shell script) allows to change the desired number of threads even after `loop.sh` has been started. Always `cd` at first to the directory of the analysis step before executing `start.sh` or `loop.sh`.

If you only want to compile a component of HIMEana, without starting it directly, simply type `make` in the corresponding directory. In order to compile from scratch, type `make clean` at first. Starting an analysis should **always** be done using one of the shell scripts!
