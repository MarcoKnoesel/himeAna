# enter the path to the root file which your data has been written to
unset path
# or leave "path" empty and read all files from the following directory:
subdir="2023-01-03"
#
# enter the name of the TDC you want to look at
tdc="TDC_2480"
#
# select here the channels you want to look at
# (called "channels of interest" in the following)
ch0=0
ch1=8
# set the following two channels to "-1" if you only want to look at two channels
ch2=4
ch3=12

# *** How to set which files are read ***
# 
# ** 1st possibility **
# Set the variable "path" to the complete path to a root file, such as
#     ~/my_file.root
#
# ** 2nd possibility **
# Leave "path" empty and set the directory "subdir".
# Then, all ROOT files inside that directory are read.
