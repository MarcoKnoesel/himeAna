/*
 * This class represents a set of scintillator modules. Each module has two PMTs.
 * Each PMT has its own channel number in the range from 0 to 48 times the number of TDCs. 
 * A PMT object has a std::vector of Pulse objects, where the time stamps of rising and falling signals are stored in.
 * 
 * In the constructor of the class Detector, Module objects are created. Each one will get 2 PMTs.
 * Therefore, the constructor determines which channels are connected to each module.
